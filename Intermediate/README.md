# Hello-World

Welcome to the Intermediate Class of the 3rd Cohort for AISaturdaysLagos. For this class, we used 3 courses, which are:
1. Cs231n course (Spring 2017 version)
2. FastAI course
3. Intel's Computer Vision


1.Cs231n course (Spring 2017 version):
 Cs231n is a deep learning course offered by Standford University. The course is taught by Fei-Fei Li, Justin Johnson and Serena Yeung of the Standford Vision Lab.This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.

2.FastAI course:
 The FastAI is a course based on the FastAI Library taught by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas. Fast.ai sits on top of a library called PyTorch which is a really flexible deep learning, machine learning, and GPU computation library written by Facebook. We also used Medium Post by Hiromi Suenaga on Deep Learning explaining the videos from Jeremy and Rachel.

3.Intel's Computer Vision:
 This course provides an overview of computer vision on modern IntelÂ® architecture. Topics includes Understanding how to use computer vision in industry, Learning the main algorithms for image processing and Exploring how machine learning is used in computer vision.
The course is structured around eight weeks of lectures and exercises. Each week requires three hours to complete.
